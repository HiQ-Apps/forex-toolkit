# Forex Toolkit
[![All Contributors](https://img.shields.io/badge/all_contributors-1-orange.svg?style=flat-square)](#contributors-)

A data aggregation tool that uses bots to gather text from economic news sources. 

On Friday 6/7, the US released its scheduled monthly Non Form Payroll (NFP) data that was largely positive. This caused the EUR/USD pair to fall before the market closed for the weekend. That Sunday, French president Macron called a snap election. France is one of the big five economies in the eurozone, and the political instability caused the EURO to weaken before the Asian markets opened. That day, the EURUSD gapped down another 50 pips. Later that week, amid the uncertainty of the French government, the US released some CPI data that showed inflation had slowed, which caused the pair to jump back up another 80 pips, until the rate cut announcements later that day, in which the Federal Reserve  was expected to take a dovish stance and cut interest rates. However, Powell indicated a more hawkish (higher rates and restrictions) stance and concluded that more data on the rate of inflation growth was needed in order to proceed with the rate cuts. No rate cuts signals to investors that they will receive a higher yields, and once again, after Powell‚Äôs press conference, the EUR/USD pair fell. 

Being able to understand the fundamentals of trading forex involves seeing the interconnectedness of the global economies. My hypothesis is that price action will move towards liquidity, or cash flow, in the absence of exogenous forces. When any news comes out, especially high impact news such as elections or policy changes, increased volatility of the markets follows. Market participants can and should adjust their strategies accordingly to protect their investments. While indicators provide a mathematical basis and sound logic to predict future movements, nothing can fully prepare for the shockwaves that influence price action.

That morning, I woke up at 5:20 am before the CPI news came out and made sure to watch in real time so I could witness the effects of such news on market conditions. Just as Powell mentioned in the press conference, ‚Äúdata is king‚Äù.

The purpose of the forex toolkit is both practical and selfish. I made it for myself so that I could react to the news quickly to make money so I wouldn‚Äôt have to work soul crushing, mind numbing jobs anymore. But I also wanted to push the limits of myself as a developer. FTK gathers data from a variety of sources such as economic calendars, meeting minutes, and the breaking news the eurozone and the US. Additional factors such as the dollar index (DXY) are added, as the DXY has an inverse trend relationship with the EUR/USD. 

Additionally, a quick glance at the GBP/USD from that week show similar price movement in reaction to the news. This garners additional consideration when looking for other entries in related markets.

I am focusing solely on this pair as it is the most traded pair - on average, it moves 290 pips daily. The amount of news surrounding the United States itself is massive and will take a large net to capture pertinent data. Asynchronous tasks of pulling the data will be running constantly to watch for news. The data will be aggregated and categorized, and then be fed into models in order to generate predictions. Two years of historical price data for the EUR/USD will be be referenced with the times of high impact news releases. The effects of news will be measured as a change in price immediately before and after, with different time frames being taken into consideration.
